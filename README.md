This is a short little python script that will allow you to play my rendition of the popular board game Mastermind through CMD. This was just practice for myself as all of the code is written from memory and condense to be as small as possible.
You can simply download this as a ZIP and extract it anywhere. It includes all of the Python tools needed to run automatically.
